# Image2ASCII Converter

This Python project converts digital images into ASCII art. When you run the code, a window opens with two buttons: "Upload File" and "Save".

## Usage
**Upload File Button:** Click this button to select any image from your computer. The selected image will be displayed on the left side of the window, while the corresponding ASCII art will be shown on the right side.

**Save Button:** After uploading an image and generating the ASCII art, you can click the "Save" button to save the ASCII art as a text file.
